# Smartcar Core
A library that extends the Adafruit Motor Shield library in order to provide some high level functions to the user of a Smartcar.

### What
This library is based on a specific hardware platform (an Arduino based remote controlled car), the "Smartcar" and is developed for educational purposes within the context of an experiment on API evaluation, by Dimitris Platis.

### How
Students of the DIT524 course, of University of Gothenburg will be tasked to develop a system composed of at least an Android Application and an Arduino sketch controlling the car.
- The Android application that shall remotely control the Smartcar, get from and send data to it and initiate automated tasks.
- The Arduino sketch will utilize the Smartcar library in order to easily achieve basic control of the car and will help to realize the various functionalities needed by the students.

The students will provide constant feedback on the API, which will aid in the extraction of various findings and conclusions on the subject of API evaluation.

### Dependencies
- The smartcar hardware platform
- [Adafruit motor shield library]
